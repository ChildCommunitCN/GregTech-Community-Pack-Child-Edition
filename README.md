# GregTech-Community-Pack

Repository for the GregTech Community Modpack - a minecraft modpack for 1.12.2 highlighting and featuring [GregTech Community Edition Unofficial](https://github.com/GregTechCEu/GregTech).

## Playing

Go to [Releases](https://github.com/GregTechCEu/GregTech-Community-Pack/releases) and download `client.zip`.
~~Drag and drop the archive file into MultiMC or another launcher of your choice.~~
Due to Curseforge API change, you will have to use their launcher, or download most things manually, until a (hopefully) better option shows up.

## Building

You need `Python3` and `Python Requests` installed. Building is done through running the `main.py` script.

## Credits
